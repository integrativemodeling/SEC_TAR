# Integrative structure of the Tat:AFF4:P-TEFb:TAR complex

To model the Tat:AFF4:P-TEFb:TAR complex, we applied integrative structure determination based on the atomic structure of a complex containing Tat, AFF4, and P-TEFb (PDB ID 4OGR), an atomic structure of TAR (PDB ID 1ARJ and 2KX5), a small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS) profile of the complex, difference HDX data for the apo and TAR complexes, the SHAPE data describing the interactions between the HIV-1 5â€™UTR and the Tat-AFF4-P-TEFb complex, and previously published biochemical data identifying key residues for the recognition of TAR.  In particular, because only a binary complex needed to be modeled, we followed an integrative docking protocol.

## Directories

`data`: contains the SAXS profiles of the apo and TAR complexes

`TAR_ensemble`: 21 TAR conformers obtained from PDBs 1ARJ and 2KX5

`foxs`: scripts to run PATCHDOCK and initial models of the SEC apo complex

`scripts`: scripts used for filtering, clustering and optimization of the models

`models`: represetative structures of the top scoring clusters
